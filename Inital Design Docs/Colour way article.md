I really like design systems, which is why I actively engage in constructing or enhancing them in every product I am involved with. In most products, the color palette appeared quite disorganized, and I have an idea why.

The intuitive approach is to gradually incorporate these colors as needed, step by step. If I require a grey shade for the secondary texts, I simply add it. Similarly, if I need a lighter grey for the icons, I add that too.
Now, I require a grey color to outline the text fields. However, this particular grey is too dark for separators. It starts to snowball, and at some point, the colors spiral out of control, leading to a loss of system coherence. Familiar situation?

A crowd of gray colors appears in random order, creating a mess.
In fact, the process of working with colors is very similar across all interfaces, no matter how different they may be. In each standard interface, we require:

Black colors üñ§ for primary texts and icons.
Grey shades ü©∂ for secondary texts, icons, and strokes.
An accent color üíô for buttons and other clickable elements.
Red ‚ù§Ô∏è, green üíö, and orange üß° for negative, positive, and warning states.
White ü§ç for surfaces and elements on an accent or dark background.
Plus, a few extra colors ü©µ üíú ü©∑ üíõ for charts or badges.

I highly recommend preparing shade palettes for each color before embarking on the interface design process. I‚Äôll showcase the method we implemented at Aloha Browser, hoping you find it valuable.

Palette Creation
I typically begin with the accent color. Often it is a brand color that gives our interface a distinctive look. Most likely, we will need shades of this color. Let‚Äôs prepare them.

To ensure a smooth transition between shades and maintain consistency in tone, let‚Äôs use a gradient. It‚Äôs an excellent technique I picked up from my former colleague.

You don‚Äôt have to begin with #000000 and end with #ffffff in your gradients. Utilize colors that you intend to use in the interface.

Now, divide the gradient into 9 equal segments and move the gradient endpoints to the center of the first and last segments.

Pick the central shade from each segment, and you‚Äôll have your initial palette.

Occasionally, using shades of the same tone in the interface may appear dull. Take a look, if you make the lighter shades warmer, the overall appearance becomes more lively.

Don‚Äôt be afraid to change the shades of the gradient‚Äôs endpoints if you want to make the palette more varied. In this example, I make the dark color more purple and the light color more green.

You may notice that certain colors don‚Äôt look quite satisfactory. By introducing extra points to the gradient and adjusting the brightness, your palette remains accurate, but all the colors now look impeccable!

Creating more palettes
Once you are happy with your accent color, employ the same approach to create palettes for red, green, and orange colors.

Don‚Äôt forget that orange becomes muddy if you darken it through black. Add a touch of red to make the orange darker.

Black, Grey and White palettes
Once you are satisfied with these initial colors, shift your focus to the blacks and greys. Now you are able to select the appropriate tone for your texts and strokes.

Basic gray and black colors are created as shades of blue.
I would recommend splitting black, grey, and white palettes, even if they consist of just shades of the same color. Interfaces typically require a variety of greys and blacks, especially when supporting a dark mode.
Hence, it would be more convenient if you separate them into distinct palettes. Additionally, this will significantly facilitate the use of transparent shades, which we will discuss later.

Even if you don‚Äôt plan to use the ultimate black color #000000 in your interface, I recommend adding it to your palette. It might be necessary for the background of a video player or image gallery.

Transparent Colors
Until now, we‚Äôve only discussed solid opaque colors. However, there are often cases where we need colors with transparency, such as for overlays or various visual effects.

In most cases, these are transparent shades of black and white.
If you require transparent elements of a vibrant color, select a certain shade of it and add it to the palette with varying levels of transparency.

Vibrant Colors in Dark Mode
If you are implementing dark mode in your interface, establish distinct palettes for vibrant colors with reduced brightness. The black and grey palettes will work seamlessly for both dark and light modes.

Additional Colors
At Aloha, we are passionate about colors! We use additional colors for charts and badges. While we don‚Äôt necessarily need a variety of shades for these hues, we‚Äôve decided to gather them into a single palette.

Utilizing Color Palettes
Now it‚Äôs time to integrate our colors into the interface. First, we will assign names to our colors. Within each palette, we will assign numbers to the shades ranging from 100 to 900.

Why this instead of 1, 2, 3‚Ä¶? This approach enables us to insert as many shades in between as needed, such as 550, 575, or 950, 975, and so on.

Congratulations! We‚Äôve established our core palette. Envision it as the paint set for your interface. As the next step, we will establish some guidelines for using these colors in the interface to prevent chaos in this array of hues. In my upcoming article, we will delve into understanding our palettes and introduce a semantic layer.
